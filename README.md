Hello! My name is Cam Rudolph. I come from Festus, MO and have 4 brothers. The reason I am here at *Murray State* is to learn code and eventually be able to design video games. Video games have become a pinacle for my life because the way that I grew up. I bonded most with my brother by playing video games with them and still do to this day. So it has been my dream to create games for people and give them the same experince that I had. This will be my second attempt at this class and hope to do better that I had in the previous semester.
